# CROP-YIELD-PREDICTION
Crop yield is highly influenced by climatic conditions and soil quality. In this project, I built a machine learning-based predictive system that estimates crop production based on historical agricultural data.

## Project Description
Crop Yield Prediction is an important application of machine learning in agriculture. This project aims to predict crop yield based on key environmental and soil factors such as rainfall, temperature, soil nutrients, and area under cultivation.By analyzing historical agricultural data, this model helps farmers and stakeholders make better decisions for crop planning and productivity improvement.

## Objectives
- Predict crop yield using machine learning regression techniques  
- Understand the impact of soil and climatic factors on crop production  
- Provide a data-driven solution for smarter agricultural decision-making  

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains agricultural and environmental features including:
### Input Features:
- Soil nutrients (N, P, K values)
- Rainfall (mm)
- Temperature (°C)
- Area under cultivation (hectares)

### Target Variable:
- Crop Yield (production per hectare)
## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**
   - Collected historical crop and environmental datasets
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing duplicates  
   - Feature scaling and formatting  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Studied relationships between yield and factors like rainfall and soil nutrients  
   - Visualized trends and correlations  
4. **Model Building**
   Implemented regression algorithms such as:
   - Linear Regression  
   - Decision Tree Regressor  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
5. **Model Evaluation**
   Evaluated model performance using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - R² Score 

## Results
- The machine learning model successfully predicts crop yield based on environmental and soil conditions.
- Random Forest Regression achieved better performance compared to other models.
- Rainfall and soil nutrient levels were found to have a strong influence on yield.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Machine Learning Regression Models  

##  Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time weather forecasting APIs  
- Use deep learning models for improved accuracy  
- Build a web or mobile app for farmers  
- Expand dataset for multiple crops and regions  
- Include additional parameters like humidity and soil moisture
